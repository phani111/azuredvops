#This Azure Pipelines YAML file defines a CI/CD pipeline for a backend API application. The pipeline has two stages:

#1. **Build**: This stage builds a Docker image for the backend API and pushes it to Docker Hub.
#2. **Deploy**: This stage deploys the Docker image to an Azure Container Apps environment.

#The pipeline is triggered on changes to the `main` branch, and only for changes to the `azure-pipelines.yaml` file. The pipeline uses the following variables:
#- `IMAGE_NAME`: The name of the Docker image to be built and pushed.
#- `CONTAINERAPPS_APP`: The name of the Azure Container Apps application to deploy to.
#- `CONTAINERAPPS_ENVIRONMENT`: The name of the Azure Container Apps environment to deploy to.
#- `RESOURCE_GROUP`: The name of the Azure resource group containing the Container Apps environment.
#- `TAG`: The build ID, which is used as the Docker image tag.
